## Workflow

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Data is collected and cleaned.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Features are extracted and transformed.
3.  **Individual Model Training:** Multiple machine learning models are trained.
4.  **Ensemble Model Construction:** An ensemble model is created.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
6.  **Usage:** The model can be used for prediction and analysis.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r code/requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Explore the `code/` directory for scripts and notebooks.**
5.  **Refer to the `data/README.md` for data details.**
